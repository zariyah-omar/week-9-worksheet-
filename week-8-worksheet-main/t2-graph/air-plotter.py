You have been provided with ‘leeds-central-air-quality.csv’ which is a file containing air quality data for Leeds from the last few years. There are 4 values – particulate matter (25), particulate matter (10), Ozone and Nitrous Oxide which are all different measures of air quality – which are recorded against the date.
Load this file into a suitable data structure.

From this data, create a line plot of the average of the 4 data points against the date.

For example, for the row:
07/09/2024,68,20,25,5

You would plot a point at (68+20+25+5)/4 = 29.5

The X-axis should be the date, the Y-axis should be the average pollution.
