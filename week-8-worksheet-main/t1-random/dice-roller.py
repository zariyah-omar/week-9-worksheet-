'''
Create a program which simulates rolling a 6-sided die a number of times. The user should enter the number of times they want to the dice to be rolled, and the program will then print each one.
Example:
python dice.py
How many times should I roll the die?: 3
You have rolled a 3
You have rolled a 6
You have rolled a 1

This involves inputting a number, so you should ensure your code is robust and can handle unusual inputs such as negatives or non-numerical values.

Extension:
You could also create a class ‘Dice’ and allow users to generate a die with any (valid) number of sides.
